Eventually, everyone will have been infected. Thus, our model is most realistic for the earliest stages of an epidemic.\n\n## Data collection\n\nWe model samples collected from a single sampling site at regular intervals, spaced $\\delta t$ apart.\nThe material for the sample is collected uniformly over a window of length $w$.\n(When $w \\to 0$, we have a single grab sample per collection, when $w \\to \\delta t$ we have continuous sampling.)\nEach sample is sequenced to a total depth of $n$ reads.\n\nWe also consider the a delay of $t_d$ between the collection of the sample and the data processing.\nThis delay accounts for sample transport, sample prep, sequencing, and data analysis.\n\n## Read counts\n\nWe considered three different models of the number of reads in each sample from the epidemic virus:\n\n1. A deterministic model where the number of reads in a sample at time t is equal to its expected value:\n   $$\n   \\text{\\# reads} = \\mu = n b \\int_{t-w}^{t} p(t') \\frac{dt'}{w},\n   $$\n   where $b$ is a factor that converts between prevalence and relative abundance.\n   This is the factor that we esotimated in [link to P2RA ms](link).\n   The integral represents the average prevalence over the sampling window.\n2. A stochastic model that accounts for Poisson counting noise and variation in the latent relative abundance.\n   In this model, the number of reads is a random variable drawn from a Poisson-gamma mixture with mean $\\mu$ (as in 1.) and inverse overdispersion parameter $\\phi$.\n   Large $\\phi$ means that the relative abundance is well-predicted by our deterministic model, whereas small $\\phi$ means that there is a lot of excess variation beyond what comes automatically from having a finite read depth.\n3. A stochastic model where we sequence a pooled sample of $n_p$ individuals.\n   This allows us to consider the effect of sampling a small number of, e.g., nasal swabs rather than wastewater.\n   We worked on a similiar model in [this blog post](https://naobservatory.org/blog/simulating-approaches-to-metagenomic-pandemic-identification).\n\nSee [NAO Cost Estimate MVP](./2024-02-02_CostEstimateMVP.html) for details on the deterministic model,\nand [NAO Cost Estimate -- Adding noise](./2024-02-22_StochasticMVP.html) for details on the stochastic models.\n\n## Detection\n\nWe model detection based on the cumulative number of viral reads over all samples.\nWhen this number reaches a threshold value $\\hat{K}$, the virus is detected.\n\nThis model of detection is much simpler than some of our ideas for detection, including looking for patterns of exponential growth in the read abundances.\nHowever, it captures the basic idea that all detection methods need some baseline number of reads to have any power.\n\n## Costs\n\nWe considered two components of cost:\n\n1. The per-read cost of sequencing $d_r$\n2. The per-sample cost of collection and processing $d_s$\n\nSee [NAO Cost Estimate -- Optimizing the sampling interval](./2024-02-08_OptimalSamplingInterval.html)\nfor details.\n\n# Results\n\n## Sequencing effort required in a deterministic model\n\nIn [NAO Cost Estimate MVP](./2024-02-02_CostEstimateMVP.html), we found the sampled depth per unit time required to detect a virus by the time it reaches cumulative incidence $\\hat{c}$ to be:\n$$\n\\frac{n}{\\delta t} = (r + \\beta) \\left(\\frac{\\hat{K}}{b \\hat{c}} \\right)\n    \\left(\\frac\n        {e^{-r\\delta t} {\\left(e^{r \\delta t} - 1\\right)}^2}\n        {{\\left(r \\delta t\\right)}^2}\n        \\right)\n    e^{r t_d}.\n$$\nThis result is for grab sampling, which in our model is a good approximation for windowed-composite sampling when $r w \\ll 1$.\n\nIf we take the limit that $r \\delta t$ and $r t_d$ go to zero, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{n}{\\delta t} \\to (r + \\beta) \\left(\\frac{\\hat{K}}{b \\hat{c}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the result of our simpler model in [link to P2RA](link).\nIt shows that the required sampling depth is directly proportional to the detection threshold ($\\hat{K}$) and inversely proportional to the number of reads expected per infected individual ($b$) and the target cumulative incidence ($\\hat{c}$).\nAlso, faster growing epidemics (larger $r$) require more sequencing depth than slower ones.\nThis is because\n\nThe third term in parentheses is an adustment factor for collecting samples at $\\delta t$ intervals.\nIt includes two factors:\n\n1. the delay between when the virus is theoretically detectable and the next sample taken, and\n2. the benefit of taking a grab sample late in the sampling interval when the prevalence is higher.\n\nThis term has Taylor expansion $1 + \\frac{{(r \\delta t)}^2}{12} + \\mathcal{O}{(r\\delta t)}^3$.\nAs long as $r \\delta t \\lesssim1$, this factor is small.\n\nThe final term is the cost of the $t_d$ delay between sampling and data processing.\nNote that the cost grows exponentially with $t_d$, suggesting that minimizing this delay is important.\n\n## Optimal sampling interval\n\nIn [NAO Cost Estimate -- Optimizing the sampling interval](./2024-02-08_OptimalSamplingInterval.html),\nwe found the sampling interval $\\delta t$ that minimized the total cost.\nLonger $\\delta t$ between samples saves money on sample processing, but requires more depth to make up for the delay of waiting for the next sample after the virus becomes detectable.\nWe found that the optimal $\\delta t$ satisfies (again for grab sampling):\n\n$$\nr \\delta t \\approx {\\left(\n    6 \\frac{d_s}{d_r} \\frac{b \\hat{c}}{\\hat{K}}\n    \\left( \\frac{r}{r + \\beta} \\right)\n    e^{- r t_d}\n    \\right)}^{1/3}.\n$$\n\nIntuitively, the length of the optimal sampling interval increases with the cost of sample processing relative to the cost of sequencing.\nAlso, if you have better data (higher $b$) or a lower detection threshold (smaller $\\hat{K}$), you can tolerate longer intervals.\nOn the other hand, longer delays (larger $t_d$) necessitate more frequent samples.\n\n## Additional sequencing required to ensure a high probability of detection\n\nIn [NAO Cost Estimate -- Adding noise](./2024-02-22_StochasticMVP.html),\nwe changed our detection criterion from requiring the expected number of reads to reach the threshold $\\hat{K}$\nto requiring that the number of reads reach $\\hat{K}$ with high probability, $p$.\nWe investigated how much higher the cumulative incidence has to be to meet the second criterion than the first.\n\nWe found that a key parameter is $\\nu = \\frac{\\phi}{r \\delta t}$, which measures the departure of the read count distribution from Poisson.\nWhen the inverse overdispersion parameter $\\phi$ is small, $\\nu$ is also small and the cumulative read count distribution is overdispersed relative to Poisson.\nOn the other hand, when the sampling interval $\\delta t$ is small so that the cumulative read count is the sum over many samples, $\\nu$ is large and the cumulative read count distribution is approximately Poisson.\n\nNumerical exploration of these regimes suggests that we expect to need 1.5--3 times more sequencing than the deterministic model predicts to detect with 95% probability by the target cumulative incidence.\n\n## Small pool noise\n\nIn the [Appendix](./2024-02-22_StochasticMVP.html#appendix-small-pool-noise) to the noise notebook,\nwe showed that the effect of pooling a small number of samples is controlled by $a$, the average number of viral reads each infected person contributes to the sample.\nWith fixed sampling depth, $a$ is inversely proportional to the pool size.\nWe found that if the detection threshold is one read $\\hat{K} = 1$, sequencing depth required to ensure a given probability of detection increases in proportion to\n$$\n\\frac{a}{1 - e^{-a}}.\n$$\nWe expect a similar result to hold for higher detection thresholds.\n\nIn a recent [blog post](https://naobservatory.org/blog/simulating-approaches-to-metagenomic-pandemic-identification), we used simulations to address a similar question.\n\n# Conclusions\n\n- Our analysis here confirms the intuition that the ratio of expected relative abundance of sequence reads to viral prevalence (here $b$) is very important for cost. We found in [link to P2RA](link) that this factor varies over several orders of magnitude for different viruses and studies, suggesting that optimizing sequencing and sample processing protocols is crucial to a successful NAO.\n- The sampling interval is not expected to be very important for cost, assuming $r \\delta t < 1$.\n  This is because the cost of delay from longer interval is partially offset by the benefit of sampling later when the prevalence is higher.\n- In constrast, the delay between sample collection and data analysis could matter a lot because it does not have a corresponding benefit. The required depth grows exponentially with $r t_d$.\n- We have sometimes considered the benefit to noise in the read count distribution.\n  Noisier distributions sometimes let us detect something while it is still too rare to detect on average.\n  However, our analysis here shows that if our goal is to detect by the target cumulative incidence with high probability, noise is unambiguously bad and could increase our required depth several times over.\n- We currently do not have any estimate of $\\phi$, the inverse overdispersion of read counts relative to Poisson. We should try to measure it empirically in our sequence data.\n\n## Limitations and extensions\n\n- The current model considers only one epidemic location and one sampling site. For a global monitoring system, we would want to consider the effects of geographic structure. An extended model could be used to determine the optimal number and configuration of sampling locations.\n- The current epidemic model is completely deterministic. In practice, the spread of a virus is random. Because a population monitoring system can only hope to detect the virus when it has infected a sizeable number of people, this randomness should not have a large effect in a simple model like this one.\n- We would like consider a more sophisticated detection model than just cumulative reads.\n  In particular, we are interested in detection methods that use the pattern of read counts over time and space as a signal of increasing prevalence.\n- It would be useful to explore the noise distribution of real data and try to measure $\\phi$ and whether the latent noise is mostly independent or correlated between samples.\n\n",
