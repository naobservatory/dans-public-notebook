Informal writeups by [Dan Rice](https://dp-rice.github.io/) of his work on the [Nucleic Acid Observatory](https://naobservatory.org/).
The intended audience is typically other NAO team members, especially future Dan.
Expect incomplete posts, insufficient background, broken links to non-public documents, etc.
For polished, accessible writeups of NAO work, see our [blog](https://naobservatory.org/blog/).
